# 2 Ship 2 Harkinian Android

Android port of 2 Ship 2 Harkinian, based on the HarbourMasters project.

Original repository: https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian

Current Android release: **v4.0.2-android.3.4**

Supported: Android 7+ with OpenGL ES 3.0+

Tested on: Android 15

## Installation

1. Install the APK from the releases page: https://github.com/linkzenic/2ship2harkinian-Android/releases
2. Open the app once so it can create the data folder and copy bundled support files.
3. When prompted, select your legally obtained `MM.z64` ROM so the app can generate `mm.o2r`.
4. Subsequent launches should start directly into the game.

Use the Back, Select, or minus controller button, or the Android back gesture/button, to open the 2 Ship 2 Harkinian menu. Use touch controls or a controller to navigate menus.

## Data Folder

The app stores user data in the selected 2S2H data folder. You can view the current folder and change it from Settings > General.

Mods and user preset files should be placed in the relevant folders inside the selected data folder.

## FAQ

**Why is it immediately crashing?**

Try deleting and regenerating `mm.o2r` from your own ROM.

**My controller is not doing anything.**

Open the menu and check Settings > Controls to confirm the controller is detected and mapped.

**Can I hide the on-screen touch controls?**

Yes. Use Settings > General > Disable Touch Controls.

**Can I resize the menu?**

Yes. Use Settings > General > Menu Scale.

## Known Issues

Orientation lock is limited by SDL behavior on Android: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/6090

Near-plane clipping can occur when the camera is close to walls.

## Build Notes

Android builds are produced through GitHub Actions. The APK bundles `2ship.o2r` support data, but does not bundle `mm.o2r`; users generate `mm.o2r` from their own ROM.
